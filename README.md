Almost two years ago(2021), at the IUST, we had a project for a programming course with Python.
Our team (two members and one mentor) finally chose to write a Telegram bot through which it can access the desired ads on the Divar site.
You can see the output of our teamwork in this section, and also to work with this robot, you can refer to the address `https://t.me/TBCproject_bot`.

## How this bot work:
As mentioned, this robot is for communicating with the Divar site and sending targeted ads to the user.
The way it works is that the user sends the city, category, price range, etc and finally, the ads that are on the site and match the information sent by the user are sent to the user.

## What have we learned along the way?
- Coding with Python and searching when faced with problems
- Teamwork
- Working with a cloud platform (Heruku)
